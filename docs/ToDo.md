## Working on

- (empty)

## Planned

### Automatic calculation of width of table

This should be based on the both the longest text in each column and  the maximum table with based on the paper width.

Some properties to take into consideration

- Each column should have a minimum width
- If the table is wider than paper-width it should be shrunk to
paper width while maintaining the relative width of columns and 
still respecting the minimum column width. 
- In the first version word wrapping is not supported.

## Suggestions

 - Support for multi line texts in cells
 - Automatic word wrap in cells based on cell width. This should be a basic word wrapping at word boundaries
